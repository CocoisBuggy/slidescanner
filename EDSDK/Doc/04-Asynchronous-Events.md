#Asynchronous Events

In the case of asynchronous events, notify the host computer of changes, such as changes in the state of properties of remote cameras.

To enable an application to receive issued events, you must prepare callback functions for event reception and register them in the EDSDK by means of EdsSetPropertyEventHandler, EdsSetObjectEventHandler, EdsSetCameraStateEventHandler, EdsSetCameraAddedHandler, EdsSetProgressCallback, or other APIs for configuring callback functions.

For details on callback function types, see the parameters information of the APIs for callback function configuration.

This section describes events that can be retrieved by callback functions registered using EdsSetPropertyEventHandler, EdsSetObjectEventHandler, and EdsSetCameraStateEventHandler in particular.
